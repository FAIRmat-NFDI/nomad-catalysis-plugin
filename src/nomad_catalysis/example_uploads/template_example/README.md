# Introduction
Welcome to the Heterogeneous Catalysis Example upload showcasing some functionalities of the [`nomad-catalysis` plugin](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin).
In this example upload you find template files for easy generation of catalyst sample and catalytic reaction entries. The data for the entries is read out from excel sheets which you can download for automatic generation of catalyst sample and catalytic reaction entries [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin/main/src/nomad_catalysis/example_uploads/template_example/template_CatalysisCollection.xlsx). For further templates for datasets with exclusively one or more Catalyst Sample entries are [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin/main/src/nomad_catalysis/example_uploads/template_example/template_CatalystSampleCollection.xlsx) or for single Catalytic Reaction entry [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-catalysis-plugin/main/src/nomad_catalysis/example_uploads/template_example/template_CatalyticReaction.xlsx). More options for properties which can be read in directly from the excel sheet can be found in the [nomad-catalysis plugin documentation](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nomad-catalysis-plugin/) [here](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nomad-catalysis-plugin/how_to/use_this_plugin.html#format-of-the-csv-or-xlsx-data-file).
