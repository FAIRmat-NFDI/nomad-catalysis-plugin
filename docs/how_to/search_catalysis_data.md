#How to Search Catalysis Data


This plugin provides a dedicated heterogeneous catalysis app which makes it possible to get a quick overview of related entries, visualize results and search for specific information. The catalysis app of the central NOMAD service can be accessed [here](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/gui/search/heterogeneouscatalyst).

The app has 3 main components: the filter menu on the left, the dashboard in the center, and the entry list below the dashboard.
